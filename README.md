# Adventures with ANN and Percy


## Overview
This repository contains code and documents that I use as a a workspace for learning about neural networks.

As of this writing this repository has two main parts documented seperately: 

1. [A simple perceptron](doc/SimpleNet.md), a study of a single-neuron artificial neural network and its bench marking, reimplimented in various programming languages.
2. [One and two-layer perceptrons*](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/louis-frayser/Ann-and-Percy/blob/master/percy+ann/R/P+A.nb.html) Implemented in R studio as a notebook

\* A work in progress
